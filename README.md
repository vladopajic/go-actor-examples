This repository hosts various examples for [`go-actor`](https://github.com/vladopajic/go-actor).

## How to use examples

To make the most out of this read each example package found in [`/example`](/example/) directory. Every example has `bootstrap.go` that sets up logic and explains idea behind this example. It is also advised to read other source files in example directory (package).

Every example cloud be executed with following command:
```
// make run {example number}

make run 1
```
